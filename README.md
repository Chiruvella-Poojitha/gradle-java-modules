# gradle-java-modules

A place for experimenting with Java 9's module system.

Gradle doesn't currently support building Java 9 modules in a first-class way. For now, this repository acts as a place for us to
develop a shared knowledge of what we need to do to bring that first-class support to a reality in the future.

Please feel free to use the org.gradle.experimental-jigsaw Plugin developed in this repository, but understand that it is not very
sophisticated or particularly well-tested at this point in its development.
